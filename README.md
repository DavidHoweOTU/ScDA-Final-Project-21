## Acknowledgements
This project was submitted as the final course project for CSCI 2000U “Scientific 
Data Analysis” during Fall 2021. The authors certify that the work in this 
repository is original and that all appropriate resources are rightfully cited.

## README (Outline how to run the code to recreate the pdf)
To properly run the included Jupyter notebook and recreate our results, download the repository and run 
the notebook in the same directory as the CSV files containing the original dataset. Run all cells 
in the order they appear in the notebook. Rerunning cells or running cells in the wrong order
may cause errors. If this happens, restarting the kernel will fix the issue.
