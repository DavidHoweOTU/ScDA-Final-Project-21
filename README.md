## README
To properly run the included Jupyter notebook and recreate our results, download the repository and run 
the notebook in the same directory as the CSV files containing the original dataset. Run all cells 
in the order they appear in the notebook. Rerunning cells or running cells in the wrong order
may cause errors. If this happens, restarting the kernel will fix the issue.
