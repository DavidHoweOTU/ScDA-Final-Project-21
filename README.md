## Introduction
If you were bored during the pandemic in 2020, chances are you played "Among Us" with your friends.
It's a simple multiplayer-based indie game where "crewmates" work together to find which players in the group
are "imposters" before the imposters can kill them all. It's a game full of deception and reasoning, so
understandably, every player plays the game with their own strategies. But which one is the best?

## README (Outline how to run the code to recreate the pdf)
To properly run the included Jupyter notebook and recreate our results, download the repository and run 
the notebook in the same directory as the CSV files containing the original dataset. Run all cells 
in the order they appear in the notebook. Rerunning cells or running cells in the wrong order
may cause errors. If this happens, restarting the kernel will fix the issue.
