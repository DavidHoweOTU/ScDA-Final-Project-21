## Introduction
If you were bored during the pandemic in 2020, chances are you played "Among Us" with your friends.
It's a simple multiplayer-based indie game where "crewmates" work together to find which players in the group
are "imposters" before the imposters can kill them all. It's a game full of deception and reasoning, so
understandably, every player plays the game with their own strategies. But which one is the best? \
\
Is it smarter to focus on voting out imposters or go for a task win? Does completing more tasks or fixing sabotages increase your chances of getting killed? How often do players on average, correctly vote out imposters? And which one is really the easiest? Playing as a crewmate or an imposter? These are the questions we set out to answer, and through the power of data analysis, here's what we found...

## Discussion

## Conclusion
Limitations and future directions:     
Certain other stats like, when someone dies, what map they played on, and where they died and records of chat messages from players would have been incredibly useful.

Future: To get more data and record more types of info and do similar tests.

Things we did not predict:  
* We orginally thought more sabotage fixes would lead to more murder, but it was the opposite.

What did we learn:
*   By completing sabotages you are more likely to survive the duration of the game.
*   Try to do the long tasks in the beginning of the game then the short ones torwards the end to have a better surivival rate.

*   Ensure you have good teammates than can work together and be able to vote collectively to increase win rate.
*   While only voting is a good way to win the game, still focus on your tasks as it is better chance for the long run to secure the win.

To properly run the included Jupyter notebook and recreate our results, download the repository and run 
the notebook in the same directory as the CSV files containing the original dataset. Run all cells 
in the order they appear in the notebook. Rerunning cells or running cells in the wrong order
may cause errors. If this happens, restarting the kernel will fix the issue.
